</ol>

### Description:

🛠️ <b>Tools and languages used</b>: TypeScript, React, HTML, CSS
<br>
🤔 <b>Why I want to create this project</b>: Studies have shown you are 42% more likely to achive your goals just by writing them down. I've been writing down my todos every morning on a sticky note for years and thought why not make a digital app? So here we go Tasky
<br>
💆‍♀️ <b>Challenges I Faced</b>: This is my first project in TypeScript, so it takes some effort to specify types for every useState and function.
<br>
😊 <b>What's fun</b>: Implementing the drag and drop feature using the react-beautiful-dnd npm package has been super fun. I'm a big fan of combo board and it's more smooth from a UI perspective to move completed tasks to a different column.
<br>
📕 <b>Learning resources</b>: I want to thank RoadsideCoder for his amazing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@RoadsideCoder" target="_blank">tutorial</a>.

### How to use:
